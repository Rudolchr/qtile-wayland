# qtile-wayland
My personal qtile overlay to build qtile with wayland on gentoo

This depends on some automagic on qtile side.
So in case wlroots is installed on the system
qtile will try to build with wayland support even without USE wayland set.

I took the skeletons for dev-python ebuilds from wayland-desktop overlay.  
Qtiles ebuild skeleton is from official.
